    * Completed
BONUS

If you still have time left, please consider the following:

1. Can you add a second language (if you know a language other than English) Use the
rooster as a PoC for demonstrating this. For example, this is how the Rooster sounds
differently depending on language. Please add the rooster sound in your native
tongue. 

   * Implemented

2. Can you design a RESTful API for querying these animals?
   
   * Implemented with one api
